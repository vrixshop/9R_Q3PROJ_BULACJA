			House fires are predominantly accidental, usually in relation to the use of indoor lamps, stoves or heaters that use an open flame. However, careless use of cigarettes is another leading cause of fires, and fires may also be set deliberately as public violence and arson.

				Maintain your wires.

<ul>
	<li>
		Before you plug something into a socket, try to be courteous in ensuring that the wire hasnâ€™t been torn or chewed up (in case you have any pets running around). Damaged wires can be a detrimental fire hazard and need replacing as soon as possible. Also, remember that wires do get hot when in use, so be sure to check your wire placement and avoiding passing them under a carpet or anywhere that could potentially catch fire.

				Don't smoke inside the house
			</h1>
<ul>
	<li>
		If you do smoke inside the house, itâ€™s important to always do so in a well-ventilated area and to completely put out the cigarette before you throw it away. Cigarettes have a variety of additives and materials inside of them that can continue to burn even if you think that youâ€™ve put them out. That flame can then ignite inside your trashcan or outside your home and cause a fire. If you make sure to smoke outside, watching out for stray ashes and you make sure to put the cigarette out entirely before throwing it away you can cut down on this risk.
